This is the contributor guide: how to set up the repo, change packages, add components,
test the work, and prepare releases. For the system-design overview, read
[`architecture.md`](architecture.md) first; this file is the procedural companion.

> **Junior-dev note:** If you're newer to monorepos, pnpm, or Lit, treat this as a guided map, not a memory test. The extra "why" details are here so you can trace what a command changes before you run it.

> **Repo note:** this is one monorepo, not one git repository per component. See
> [Should each component be its own git repository?](#should-each-component-be-its-own-git-repository) for the reasoning, and
> [How this ties to the GitHub repo](#how-this-ties-to-the-github-repo) for how GitHub Actions handles CI and
> releases.

## Quick start (the happy path)

If you just want a working checkout, this is the whole setup. The sections below explain
what each step does and why — reach for them when a step fails or when you start changing
the library itself.

```bash
# Prerequisite: Node 20 or later (check with `node -v`)
corepack enable      # turns on pnpm, which ships bundled with Node 16.9+
pnpm install         # install every package's deps + link the workspace packages together
pnpm build           # compile each package's styles + TypeScript into its dist/
```

You now have a fully built library. From here:

- `pnpm dev` — rebuild every package on change (watch mode)
- `pnpm test` — run the smoke-test suite (build first)
- `pnpm --filter @loomidev/<name> build` — build just one package

Stuck on `corepack enable`? See [pnpm vs npm, and how to set it up](#pnpm-vs-npm-and-how-to-set-it-up) for the `EACCES`
fallback and the full explanation of why this project uses pnpm.

## What this is, in one paragraph

LoomiUI is a **monorepo** containing many independently publishable npm packages that
together make up a Lit-based web component library. Every component is
Shadow-DOM-encapsulated and authored with Tailwind utility classes for speed, but
**Tailwind itself never ships to consumers** — it is compiled once at build time
per-package and the resulting CSS is inlined into the component's `static styles`.
Theming happens through CSS custom properties (`--loomi-*`), so a consumer can re-skin
components from their own page CSS with zero build step and zero Tailwind dependency.

## pnpm vs npm, and how to set it up

This project uses **pnpm**, not npm, as its package manager. If you've only used npm
before, here's what's different and why it matters for this specific repo.

> **In short:** pnpm saves disk space (one shared copy of each dependency), catches
> "I imported something I never declared" bugs at install time, and understands this
> repo's internal `workspace:` links. If you just want to get running, the
> [Quick start](#quick-start-the-happy-path) is enough; read on when you want the why.

### What pnpm actually changes

- **Single content-addressable store, not duplicated copies.** npm and Yarn Classic copy
  every dependency into every project's `node_modules`. pnpm downloads each exact
  package version **once** to a global store (`~/.pnpm-store`) and links it into every
  project that needs it via hard links. In a monorepo with many packages that mostly
  share `lit`, `typescript`, and `tailwindcss` as dependencies, this is the difference
  between many duplicate copies of those packages on disk and effectively one.
- **Strict, non-flat `node_modules` by default.** npm "hoists" transitive dependencies
  into a flat top-level `node_modules`, which means your code can accidentally `import`
  a package you never declared as a dependency, just because some _other_ dependency
  happened to pull it in (a "phantom dependency"). pnpm uses a symlink structure where
  only packages you actually listed in `package.json` are resolvable from your source —
  this catches real bugs (an undeclared dependency that works today and breaks the
  moment a sibling package's dependency tree changes) at install time instead of in
  production.
- **First-class workspace support, including the `workspace:` protocol.** This repo's
  internal cross-package dependencies are declared as `"workspace:^"` (see
  `packages/button/package.json`'s `dependencies`). This is a pnpm-specific protocol that
  means "resolve this from the local workspace, not the registry" during development, and
  **automatically rewrites itself to a real semver range at publish time** (see
  [Publishing to npm](#publishing-to-npm)). npm 7+ has workspace support too, but doesn't have this
  same publish-time rewriting behavior in the same mature form, and historically dedupes
  less aggressively than pnpm in large workspaces.

| n/a                          | `pnpm -r --parallel dev`               | Run in every package, all at once instead of sequentially.                               |

### Setting it up on a fresh machine

1. **Install Node.js.** Tailwind CSS v4's CLI (used by every component's build script)
   requires a reasonably modern Node — **Node 20 or later** is the safe baseline; don't
   go below that.
2. **Install pnpm.** The cleanest path is via Corepack, which ships built into Node 16.9+:

   ```bash
   corepack enable
   corepack use pnpm@9.15.9
   ```

   The root `package.json` pins `"packageManager": "pnpm@9.15.9"` specifically so that,
   once Corepack is enabled, running `pnpm` _anywhere in this repo_ transparently fetches
   and uses exactly that version regardless of what else is installed globally — this
   keeps the lockfile behavior identical across every contributor's machine.

   **If `corepack enable` fails with an `EACCES` permission error** (this happened on the
   machine this project was originally built on, when `/usr/local/bin` wasn't
   user-writable), fall back to installing pnpm directly to a location you do own:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p "$HOME/.npm-global"
   npm config set prefix "$HOME/.npm-global"
   npm install -g pnpm@9
   export PATH="$HOME/.npm-global/bin:$PATH"   # add this to your shell profile too
   ```

   Or use the official standalone installer, which doesn't touch global npm config at
   all: `curl -fsSL https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh -`

3. **Verify:** `pnpm -v` should print `9.x.x`.
4. **Install everything:**
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```
   This installs every package's `dependencies`/`devDependencies` and symlinks every
   `@loomidev/*` workspace package into every other package that depends on it.
5. **Build everything:**
   ```bash
   pnpm build
   ```

### `package.json` (root)

```json
{
  "name": "@loomidev/root",
  "private": true,
  "packageManager": "pnpm@9.15.9",
  "engines": { "node": ">=20" },
  "workspaces": ["packages/*"],
  "scripts": {
    "build": "pnpm -r --filter \"./packages/*\" build",
    "clean": "pnpm -r exec rm -rf dist tsconfig.tsbuildinfo && rm -rf node_modules/.cache",
    "dev": "pnpm -r --parallel dev",
    "typecheck": "pnpm -r typecheck",
    "test": "web-test-runner"
  }
}
```

`"private": true` physically prevents this package from ever being published by accident.
It has no `dependencies` of its own — it's purely a script runner. `pnpm -r` runs a script
in every workspace package that defines it, in dependency order (pnpm topologically sorts
by each package's own `dependencies`, so `@loomidev/theme` always builds before anything that
depends on it).

### `pnpm-workspace.yaml`

```yaml
packages:
  - "packages/*"
```

Makes pnpm treat every immediate subfolder of `packages/` as its own installable package.
Without this file, `workspace:^` ranges wouldn't resolve.

### `tsconfig.base.json`

Shared `compilerOptions`. Every package's own `tsconfig.json` is two lines —
`"extends": "../../tsconfig.base.json"` plus its own `rootDir`/`outDir`. Changing a
compiler flag for the whole library is a one-file edit, not a package-by-package chore.

### `.npmrc`

```
link-workspace-packages=true
prefer-workspace-packages=true
auto-install-peers=true
```

Tells pnpm to symlink in-workspace `@loomidev/*` dependencies locally instead of fetching
them from the registry, and to silently satisfy `peerDependencies` (like `lit`) so you
don't get nagged about them in local dev.

### `examples/`

Plain `.html` files (`index.html`, `forms.html`, `widgets.html`, `data.html`,
`pickers.html`, `dataviz.html`, `content.html`, `theme-test.html`). Each uses an
`importmap` pointing at the _built_ `dist/` output of specific packages and exercises
every attribute/variant by hand. This is how every component in this project was
**visually** verified during development, and is still the right tool for checking
rendering/layout/interaction by eye — it's a complement to, not a replacement for, the
automated smoke tests in `packages/*/test/` (see [Automated smoke tests](#automated-smoke-tests)). These
files are not part of any published package; you need `pnpm build` to have run first so
`dist/` exists before opening them.

## Anatomy of one component package

Most individual component packages follow this shape, using `button` as the example:

```
packages/button/
├─ package.json
├─ custom-elements.json        ← generated API manifest (committed; regenerate with `pnpm cem`)
├─ tsconfig.json
├─ scripts/
│  └─ build-styles.mjs        ← 4-line shim into the shared style build (scripts/lib/)
├─ src/
│  ├─ styles.css               ← hand-authored plain CSS + Tailwind utility classes
│  ├─ icons.ts                 ← (only if the component needs icons)
│  ├─ loomi-button.ts          ← the LitElement itself
│  ├─ index.ts                 ← public JS API barrel
│  └─ generated/                ← BUILD OUTPUT, gitignored, regenerated every build
│     └─ styles.css.ts          (created by build-styles.mjs, do not hand-edit)
└─ dist/                        ← BUILD OUTPUT, gitignored, this is what gets published
   ├─ index.js / .d.ts / .js.map / .d.ts.map
   ├─ loomi-button.js / .d.ts / ...
   └─ generated/styles.css.js / .d.ts / ...
```

### `package.json`

```json
{
  "name": "@loomidev/button",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "type": "module",
  "main": "./dist/index.js",
  "types": "./dist/index.d.ts",
  "files": ["dist", "custom-elements.json"],
  "customElements": "custom-elements.json",
  "exports": {
    ".": { "types": "./dist/index.d.ts", "import": "./dist/index.js" },
    "./loomi-button.js": { "types": "./dist/loomi-button.d.ts", "import": "./dist/loomi-button.js" }
  },
  "scripts": {
    "build": "node scripts/build-styles.mjs && tsc -p tsconfig.json",
    "dev": "node scripts/build-styles.mjs && tsc -p tsconfig.json --watch",
    "typecheck": "tsc -p tsconfig.json --noEmit"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@loomidev/core": "workspace:^",
    "@loomidev/icons": "workspace:^",
    "@loomidev/theme": "workspace:^"
  },
  "peerDependencies": { "lit": "^3.0.0" },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@tailwindcss/cli": "^4.0.0", "lit": "^3.3.3", "tailwindcss": "^4.0.0", "typescript": "^5.6.3"
  }
}
```

Things worth understanding line by line:

- **`"files": ["dist", "custom-elements.json"]`** — the publish allowlist. `npm publish`/
  `pnpm publish` packs _only_ these paths into the tarball. `src/`, `scripts/`,
  `node_modules/` never leave your machine. No `.npmignore` needed.
- **`"customElements": "custom-elements.json"`** — points tooling at the package's
  [Custom Elements Manifest](https://github.com/webcomponents/custom-elements-manifest):
  a generated JSON description of the tag, its attributes, properties, slots, CSS parts
  and events. IDEs, docs generators and framework integrations read it for
  autocompletion. It's **committed** (unlike `dist/`) and regenerated by `pnpm cem` at
  the repo root — rerun that whenever you change a component's public API (properties,
  events, slots, JSDoc).
- **`"exports"` has two entries.** `"."` is the barrel
  (`import { LoomiButton } from "@loomidev/button"`). `"./loomi-button.js"` is a
  _side-effecting_ entry point — `import "@loomidev/button/loomi-button.js"` executes the
  `@customElement("loomi-button")` decorator and registers the custom element. Consumers
  who just want the tag to work use the second form.
- **`dependencies` vs `peerDependencies` vs `devDependencies`** — the part most likely to
  trip you up:
  - `dependencies`: things this package genuinely needs at runtime that aren't already
    guaranteed by the consumer. `@loomidev/theme` and `@loomidev/icons` qualify — npm/pnpm's
    dedup logic ensures only one copy of each ends up installed even if five different
    `@loomidev/*` packages all depend on them.
  - `peerDependencies`: `lit`. We deliberately do **not** bundle Lit or list it as a
    regular dependency — if every component package bundled its own copy, a consumer
    installing three LoomiUI components could end up with three copies of Lit on the page
    (multiple custom element registries, broken reactivity, bloated bundle). A peer
    dependency means "I need _a_ copy of Lit ^3.0.0 to exist somewhere in your tree, you
    supply it." `auto-install-peers=true` satisfies this silently in local dev.
  - `devDependencies`: build-only tools (`tailwindcss`, `@tailwindcss/cli`, `typescript`,
    plus a dev-time copy of `lit`/`@loomidev/theme` for the build script and type-checker to
    resolve against). None of this ships.
- **`workspace:^`** — pnpm-specific: "resolve from the local workspace; rewrite to
  `^<published-version>` at publish time." See [Publishing to npm](#publishing-to-npm).

### `scripts/build-styles.mjs`

**A 4-line shim, identical across every component package**: it imports
`buildComponentStyles` from the shared implementation at
`scripts/lib/build-component-styles.mjs` (repo root) and calls it with `import.meta.url` —
so palette and Tailwind CLI resolution still happen from the package itself, against the
package's own `node_modules`. Don't put build logic in the shim; if the build needs to
change, change the shared script once and every package picks it up on its next build.

What the shared script does, in order:

1. Reads `@loomidev/theme/palette.json` (real `node_modules` resolution) for the color
   names, shades, and `prefix` (currently `"loomi"`).
2. Builds a Tailwind `@theme inline` block mapping every Tailwind color utility
   (`bg-red-600`, etc.) onto `var(--loomi-red-600, var(--_loomi-red-600-default))` —
   never a literal hex value.
3. Reads the package's own `src/styles.css` and **auto-expands** any bare
   `var(--loomi-color-shade)` reference into that same public-token-with-private-fallback
   form, so you can just write plain-looking CSS by hand.
4. Feeds all of that into the real Tailwind v4 CLI (`@tailwindcss/cli`) as a child
   process. The utilities import carries **`source(none)`** — Tailwind does _not_ scan
   the package's `.ts` sources for class names. Component templates use semantic
   `loomi-*` classes, so automatic scanning only ever matched false positives (words
   like `container` or `transform` inside TS strings) and dragged dead utilities plus
   ~7 kB of `--tw-*`/`@property` preamble into every package's generated CSS. Utility
   classes you want generated must therefore appear in `src/styles.css` itself (e.g.
   via `@apply`) or in an explicit `@source inline(...)` safelist.
5. Writes the compiled CSS into `src/generated/styles.css.ts`, wrapped as a Lit
   `CSSResult` via `unsafeCSS(...)`, exported as `componentStyles` (name overridable via
   the `exportName` option).

`@loomidev/button` is the one package whose shim passes an **options object** (see
`packages/button/scripts/build-styles.mjs`): a `safelist` of
`{ variants, props, shades }`, expanded against every palette color into an
`@source inline(...)` rule, because its color classes are built from a runtime template
string (`` `bg-${color}-600` ``) that Tailwind can't see statically — without it, those
classes would never be generated. It also passes `sources` (authored files to scan for
statically-used utilities), `exportName: "buttonStyles"`, and a custom `styleDoc` comment
for the generated file. Every other component avoids all of this by themeing through the
`--_loomi-accent` mechanism (see
[The theming model (so you don't break it)](#the-theming-model-so-you-dont-break-it)) instead of interpolated class names —
simpler, and the pattern I'd recommend for any new component over interpolated utilities.

### `src/styles.css`

Hand-authored, the real design-source-of-truth — borders, padding, `:host` rules, hover
states, etc. It's allowed to reference colors as plain `var(--loomi-gray-300)` because the
build script rewrites them with the fallback chain automatically.

### `src/loomi-button.ts`

```ts
import { LoomiElement, loomiStyles } from "@loomidev/core";
import { componentStyles } from "./generated/styles.css.js";

@customElement("loomi-button")
export class LoomiButton extends LoomiElement {
  static override styles = loomiStyles(componentStyles);
  // properties, render()...
}
```

Every component should extend `LoomiElement` (from `@loomidev/core`), never bare
`LitElement` — see [Adding a new component, step by step, step 6](#adding-a-new-component-step-by-step) for what that
buys you and why.

The import is `./generated/styles.css.js` — the **compiled output path**, `.js`
extension even from a `.ts` file. With `"moduleResolution": "Bundler"`, TypeScript
resolves this against what _will_ exist after build, not what's in `src/` right now.
**You must run `pnpm build` at least once on a fresh checkout** before TypeScript stops
complaining about a missing module — the generated file doesn't exist until the
style-build step creates it.

### `src/index.ts`

The public API surface — re-exports the component class and any exported
types/helpers. This is what `"."` in `exports` points at.

---

## The three foundation packages

These aren't components — every component depends on them.

### `packages/theme/` — `@loomidev/theme`

Single source of truth for the color palette. Key file: `palette.json` (committed,
hand-edited, **not** generated):

```json
{
  "prefix": "loomi",
  "colors": ["primary", "secondary", "red", "blue", "green", "..."],
  "shades": [50, 100, 200, "...", 950],
  "ramps": { "primary": "blue", "secondary": "slate", "red": "red", "..." }
}
```

`scripts/build-tokens.mjs` reads this plus Tailwind's own bundled default color ramps
(so default colors are never hand-typed hex — they come straight from Tailwind's oklch
values) and generates:

- `src/generated/tokens.css.ts` → exports `themeStyles`, a
  `:host { --_loomi-red-600-default: oklch(...); ... }` block. The **only** place default
  color values are declared.
- `src/generated/palette.gen.ts` → typed `LOOMI_COLORS`/`LOOMI_SHADES` consts and types.

To rebrand the entire library's custom-property prefix (e.g. `--loomi-*` →
`--acme-*`), `palette.json`'s `"prefix"` field is the **single line** to change — both
`build-tokens.mjs` and the shared component style build
(`scripts/lib/build-component-styles.mjs`) read it from there.

### `packages/core/` — `@loomidev/core`

Shared runtime helpers every component imports. Re-exports `themeStyles` and the palette
from `@loomidev/theme`, plus:

- `LoomiElement` — the base class every component extends instead of Lit's own
  `LitElement`, see [Adding a new component, step by step, step 6](#adding-a-new-component-step-by-step).
- `loomiStyles(...styles)` — `return [themeStyles, motionStyles, elevationStyles,
focusStyles, ...styles]`. Used in every component's `static styles`.
- `motionStyles` (`src/motion.ts`) — shared entrance-animation `@keyframes`
  (`loomi-fade-in`, `loomi-pop-in`, `loomi-rise-in`, `loomi-drop-in`, `loomi-slide-in`,
  `loomi-spin`) plus `--loomi-motion-duration`/`--loomi-motion-ease`/`--loomi-spin-duration`
  tokens, with `prefers-reduced-motion` handled centrally. Don't hand-roll a new
  fade/pop/slide/spin keyframe in a component package — reuse one of these.
- `elevationStyles` (`src/elevation.ts`) — the shared `--loomi-shadow-elevated`
  drop-shadow token for floating dialogs/panels (modal, drawer, floating-panel).
- `focusStyles` (`src/focus.ts`) — **deprecated, now empty.** The focus tokens moved
  into `@loomidev/theme` itself so they can flip with dark mode: `themeStyles` declares
  `--loomi-focus-ring-color` (solid color for `outline`-style rings; primary-600 light /
  primary-500 dark) and `--loomi-focus-ring` (soft halo color for
  `box-shadow: 0 0 0 3px` rings; primary-100 light / translucent primary-500 dark).
  Reference those tokens — never hardcode a bare `--loomi-primary-<shade>` for a focus
  ring; the public theme slots have no fallback, so an unfallback'd reference silently
  renders no outline at all (a real bug found and fixed this way in several components).
- `fieldStyles` + `controlSizeStyles` (`src/field.ts`) — the shared chrome for
  field-style components. `fieldStyles` carries the border/background/focus/invalid/
  disabled/minimal-variant treatment on two opt-in class hooks: `.loomi-field` (a
  focus-delegating wrapper around an inner `<input>`; states key off `:focus-within`)
  and `.loomi-trigger` (a `<button>` that _is_ the control, like select's; states key
  off `:focus-visible`). `controlSizeStyles` carries the shared `.size-tiny` …
  `.size-big` rows that set `--loomi-control-height`/`-pad-x`/`-font-size`. Every text
  field and select-style picker (input, textarea, select, datepicker, countries, …)
  composes these instead of repeating the chrome — if you're building a new form
  control, do the same and keep only layout (display, gap, padding, cursor) in your own
  `styles.css`. Local rules come later in the cascade, so equal-specificity overrides
  win.
- `watchDarkMode(listener)` (`src/dark-mode.ts`) — JS dark-mode detection for
  components whose own CSS needs to branch on dark mode (e.g. calendar's event chips,
  table). `:host-context(.dark)` has no Firefox support, so components toggle an
  `is-dark` class on themselves via this shared `MutationObserver` instead. Purely
  token-driven components don't need it — the semantic `--loomi-*` aliases already flip.
- `accentVars(color)` — the per-instance theming mechanism, see
  [The theming model (so you don't break it)](#the-theming-model-so-you-dont-break-it). A component using per-instance accent
  for its focus ring should reference `--_loomi-accent` directly rather than the shared
  focus tokens — nested `var()` inside an inherited custom property resolves at
  the element where the _outer_ property was declared, not at the element that
  consumes it, so a shared `:host`-level token can't pick up an accent set on a
  descendant wrapper.
- `cssColor(color, shade)` — single themed value for inline use (e.g. a status dot).
- `onClickOutside(el, handler)` — used by dropdowns/popovers/selects to close on outside
  click.
- `randomSuffix()` — short random id, e.g. for de-duplicating notification keys across
  component instances.
- `nextMenuFocusIndex(event, currentIndex, itemCount)` — resolves an Arrow/Home/End
  keydown into the next index to focus in a top-level menu. Extracted after `dropmenu`
  and `context-menu` turned out to have byte-for-byte identical keydown logic for this;
  it's deliberately a pure decision function (no DOM, no wrapping) rather than a
  DOM-touching helper, since the two packages' `focusItemAt()`-style methods that
  actually move focus stayed different enough (different item types, different
  close/escape behavior) not to share.
- `loomiT`/`setLoomiLocale`/`defineLoomiTranslations`/etc. (`src/i18n.ts`) — the shared
  translation lookup behind every component's built-in copy (placeholders, validation
  messages, aria labels, ...). See [Adding or updating translations](#adding-or-updating-translations) for how the
  actual translation strings are organized and how to add or edit one.

### `packages/icons/` — `@loomidev/icons`

A single `Record<string, SVGTemplateResult>` (a subset of Heroicons outline paths), plus
`registerLoomiIcon()`/`getLoomiIcon()`/`loomiIconNames()`. Every component that needs an
icon pulls from this **one shared registry** rather than maintaining its own copy — early
in this project `button` and `input` each had separate icon maps, which caused a name
collision once both got re-exported from the umbrella package. Don't reintroduce that.

---

## Why is there a `components` folder inside `packages`?

Two similarly-named things, easy to conflate:

- **`packages/`** — the _folder_. Not itself a package; pnpm just uses it as the
  location for every workspace package per `pnpm-workspace.yaml`. No `package.json` of
  its own.
- **`packages/components/`** — **one ordinary sibling package** among the other packages,
  whose npm name happens to be `@loomidev/components`. It's the "install everything"
  umbrella package: it depends on the component packages plus the foundation packages,
  and re-exports them:

```json
// packages/components/package.json (abridged)
{
  "name": "@loomidev/components",
  "dependencies": { "@loomidev/core": "workspace:^", "@loomidev/button": "workspace:^", "...": "..." },
  "exports": {
    ".": { "import": "./dist/index.js" },
    "./button": { "import": "./dist/button.js" }
  }
}
```

```ts
// packages/components/src/button.ts — one tiny re-export file
export * from "@loomidev/button";
```

That last pattern is what makes `import "@loomidev/components/button"` work — it points at
the `"./button"` entry in `exports`, letting someone who installs the umbrella still
cherry-pick a single component without pulling the whole barrel into their bundle.

It's named `components` because that's its npm package name — same logic as `@loomidev/button`
living in `packages/button/`. The folder name colliding visually with its parent
(`packages/`) is purely cosmetic; pnpm resolves packages by the `name` field in
`package.json`, never by folder name, so renaming the folder to e.g. `packages/all/` is
safe if the similarity keeps confusing people.

Three more "bundle" packages work identically but for smaller subsets, with no styles of
their own and no per-component subpaths:

- `packages/forms/` → `@loomidev/forms`
- `packages/content/` → `@loomidev/content`
- `packages/navigation/` → `@loomidev/navigation`

Their `"build"` script is just `tsc -p tsconfig.json` — nothing to compile.

---

## The theming model (so you don't break it)

For semantic surface/text tokens, dark mode, and responsive layout expectations, read
[`docs/COMPONENT_QUALITY.md`](docs/COMPONENT_QUALITY.md).

**The rule:** never declare the _public_ `--loomi-<color>-<shade>` custom property on
`:host`. Only ever declare the _private_ `--_loomi-<color>-<shade>-default` (leading
underscore) on `:host`, and reference colors everywhere else as
`var(--loomi-X, var(--_loomi-X-default))`.

**Why:** CSS custom property resolution checks an element's own declarations before
inherited ones. If a component's `:host` declared `--loomi-primary-600: #2563eb`
directly, that would **always win** over a consumer's
`:root { --loomi-primary-600: #16a34a }` — the override would silently do nothing. (This
is exactly the bug that shipped and got caught by testing in a real browser early in this
project.) By only declaring the underscore-prefixed private default, the public slot
stays empty on the component, so a consumer's `:root` override inherits straight through
the shadow boundary and wins; absent an override, `var(..., fallback)` resolves to the
private default.

This is why `@loomidev/core` exports **`accentVars(color)`**, used by any component needing a
_per-instance_ color (a red checkbox next to a green one can't both just read the global
`--loomi-primary-*`):

```ts
export function accentVars(color: LoomiColor | string): string {
  const c = color || "primary";
  return [
    `--_loomi-accent:${token(c, 600)}`,        // token() = var(--loomi-X-600, var(--_loomi-X-600-default))
    `--_loomi-accent-strong:${token(c, 700)}`,
    `--_loomi-accent-soft:${token(c, 100)}`,
    `--_loomi-accent-softer:${token(c, 50)}`,
    `--_loomi-accent-ring:${token(c, 200)}`,
    `--_loomi-accent-fg:${token(c, 700)}`,
    `--_loomi-accent-border:${token(c, 200)}`,
  ].join(";");
}
```

A component sets this as its inline `style` (`style=${accentVars(this.color)}`), and its
plain CSS reads `background: var(--_loomi-accent)`. Because `accentVars` resolves through
`token()` — which reads the _public_ slot first — a global `:root` override still
cascades correctly even though the accent is per-instance. This is the mechanism behind
checkbox/radio/toggle/tag/alert/chart/etc. supporting global theming _and_ a per-instance
`color` attribute at once.

**If you write a new component with a `color` attribute, use `accentVars()` — don't
reinvent it.**

---

## Adding a new component, step by step

1. **Decide deps first.** Needs icons? → depends on `@loomidev/icons`. Composes another
   component (like `table` needs `checkbox` + `pagination`)? → build those first, depend
   on them as regular `dependencies`.
2. **Scaffold:** `mkdir -p packages/<name>/{src,scripts}`
3. **Copy two files unchanged** from any existing sibling (e.g. `packages/timeline/`):
   `scripts/build-styles.mjs` (the 4-line shim into the shared style build) and
   `tsconfig.json`.
4. **Write `package.json`** — copy a similar component's, change `name`, `description`,
   `keywords`, the `./loomi-<name>.js` exports path, and `dependencies` (always
   `@loomidev/core`; add `@loomidev/icons`/other components as needed; always `workspace:^`).
5. **Write `src/styles.css`** — plain CSS, reference colors as `var(--loomi-gray-300)`
   or `var(--_loomi-accent)` if using `accentVars()`. Reference the semantic tokens
   (`--loomi-surface`, `--loomi-text`, `--loomi-focus-ring`, …) rather than raw gray
   shades so dark mode works for free. If you're building a **form control**, compose
   `fieldStyles` + `controlSizeStyles` from `@loomidev/core` (see [The three foundation packages](#the-three-foundation-packages))
   instead of hand-writing the field border/focus/invalid/disabled chrome — keep only
   layout in your own CSS.
6. **Write `src/loomi-<name>.ts`**:
   ```ts
   import { LoomiElement, loomiStyles /*, accentVars */ } from "@loomidev/core";
   import { componentStyles } from "./generated/styles.css.js";

   @customElement("loomi-<name>")
   export class Loomi<Name> extends LoomiElement {
     static override styles = loomiStyles(componentStyles);
   }
   declare global {
     interface HTMLElementTagNameMap { "loomi-<name>": Loomi<Name>; }
   }
   ```
   **Extend `LoomiElement`, not `LitElement`.** `LoomiElement`
   (`packages/core/src/index.ts`) is a thin `LitElement` subclass that every component
   should extend, and it's what every component's `name` attribute is built on:
   ```ts
   export class LoomiElement extends LitElement {
     static override properties = { name: { type: String, reflect: true } };
     declare name: string;
     // connectedCallback() / update() keep a stable CSS class on the host element in sync
   }
   ```
   On `connectedCallback()` and every `update()`, it applies a CSS class to the host
   element — either a sanitized version of the `name` attribute if the consumer set one
   (`<loomi-button name="submit-btn">` → class `submit-btn`), or, if not, a generated
   fallback (`loomi-button-a1b2c` style: `loomi-<component-type>-<random-suffix>`),
   swapping the old class out if `name` changes later. This gives every component a
   **stable selector to hook external CSS or test/automation code to**, without each
   component reimplementing the same `name`-to-class logic individually. If you
   extend bare `LitElement` instead, your component silently loses this — there's no
   compiler error, it just won't have a `name` attribute or the class-sync behavior every
   sibling component has.
   **Name custom events with the `loomi-` prefix.** The convention (enforced across the
   library in one breaking pass): an event that mirrors native semantics keeps the
   native name (`change`, `input`, `close`), everything else is `loomi-<something>`
   (`loomi-select`, `loomi-page-change`, `loomi-reorder`, …) so consumers can tell at a
   glance which events are loomi-specific and bare names never collide with native
   events when composed. Dispatch with `{ bubbles: true, composed: true }` so the event
   crosses the Shadow DOM boundary.
7. **Write `src/index.ts`** — `export { Loomi<Name>, type ... } from "./loomi-<name>.js";`
8. **Build it in isolation first:**
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   pnpm --filter @loomidev/<name> build
   ```
9. **Wire it into its grouping package(s)** (`forms`/`content`/`navigation`) — add to
   `dependencies` and add `export * from "@loomidev/<name>";` to `src/index.ts`.
10. **Wire it into the umbrella (`packages/components`)** — add to `dependencies`, add an
    `exports["./<name>"]` entry, add `src/<name>.ts` (`export * from "@loomidev/<name>";`),
    add the export line to `src/index.ts`.
11. **Reinstall + full rebuild:** `pnpm install && pnpm build`
12. **Write `packages/<name>/README.md`** — usage examples + full attribute table; copy
    an existing one as a template.
13. **Manually verify in a browser.** Add a section to an `examples/*.html` page,
    import via an import map pointing at `../packages/<name>/dist/loomi-<name>.js`,
    exercise every attribute/variant, check the console for errors. Use this for visual
    correctness — it's not a substitute for the smoke test in the next step.
14. **Add at least one smoke test** at `packages/<name>/test/loomi-<name>.test.ts`
    covering its core behavior (and form-association if applicable). See
    [Automated smoke tests](#automated-smoke-tests) for the pattern and how to run it.
15. **Generate the API manifest:** `pnpm cem` (repo root) writes/updates the package's
    `custom-elements.json`; commit it. Rerun whenever the public API (properties,
    events, slots, JSDoc) changes.
16. **Add it to the root `README.md`'s component table.**
17. **Record the change:** `pnpm changeset` (see [Versioning strategy](#versioning-strategy)).

---

## Automated smoke tests

There is a real, running test suite — `packages/*/test/**/*.test.ts` — using
[`@web/test-runner`](https://modern-web.dev/docs/test-runner/overview/) with a real
headless Chromium (via `@web/test-runner-puppeteer`) and
[`@open-wc/testing`](https://open-wc.org/docs/testing/testing-package/)'s `fixture()` /
`expect()` / `oneEvent()` helpers. Tests run against the **built `dist/` output**, not
the TypeScript source — they exercise the same artifact a consumer would install, so
`pnpm build` must run before `pnpm test`.

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm test                                          # the whole suite
pnpm web-test-runner --files "packages/button/test/**/*.test.ts"   # one package only
```

Config lives at the repo root in `web-test-runner.config.mjs`. Two things in there are
deliberate, not defaults:

- **`concurrency: 1`.** Running multiple test files' browser pages concurrently caused
  real, reproducible timeouts under CPU contention on a dev machine — every failing test
  was independently verified to pass reliably in isolation, confirming it was a resource
  contention issue, not a bug. Serial execution removes the variable; at this suite's
  size (dozens of tests) the wall-clock cost is negligible (a few seconds). Revisit if
  the suite grows large enough for this to matter.
- **`esbuildPlugin({ ts: true })`** strips TypeScript types when serving test files —
  it does **not** type-check them. `pnpm typecheck` doesn't cover `test/` either (each
  package's `tsconfig.json` only includes `src/**/*.ts`). A test file with a type error
  will still run; catch type issues by eye or add `test/**/*.ts` to a package's
  `tsconfig.json` `include` if you want stricter coverage.

### Current coverage

Smoke tests now exist across many packages. The table below shows useful patterns to copy
when adding or improving tests:

| Pattern                                                                         | Covered by                    | What to copy for a new component                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Plain attributes/properties, slotted content                                    | `button`                      | Any standalone component.                                                                                                                                      |
| Form association (`ElementInternals`)                                           | `checkbox`, `input`, `slider` | Any form control — `radio`, `toggle`, `checkcards`, `rating`, the pickers, etc. all follow the same `willUpdate() { this.internals.setFormValue(...) }` shape. |
| Focus management on an overlay (trap, restore, global open/close registry)      | `modal`                       | `dropmenu`, `popover` — anything that opens a floating panel and should trap/restore focus.                                                                    |
| Roving-tabindex keyboard navigation (WAI-ARIA APG)                              | `tab`                         | Any component with a row of selectable headings.                                                                                                               |
| Listbox-button keyboard pattern (`aria-activedescendant`, Arrow/Home/End/Enter) | `select`                      | `dropmenu`'s menu items, `colorpicker`'s swatch grid — anything presenting a list of choices in a popup.                                                       |

Coverage is still not exhaustive. Extend it as you touch a component, especially around
form behavior, keyboard interaction, generated CSS, and events that cross Shadow DOM.

## Adding or updating translations

> For the fuller guide — including how to make a _new_ component's copy translatable in
> the first place (the `locale` property, `loomiT` vs. `loomiDefaultText`, key naming,
> and why partial locale files are fine) — see [`i18n.md`](i18n.md). This section
> covers the built-in-language workflow specifically.

`@loomidev/core`'s `src/i18n.ts` is the shared translation lookup (`loomiT`,
`setLoomiLocale`, `defineLoomiTranslations`, `loomiMonthName`, etc.) that every component
calls into for its built-in copy — placeholders, validation messages, aria labels,
pagination strings, datepicker month/weekday names, and similar defaults. The strings
themselves don't live in `i18n.ts`: each built-in language is its own file under
`packages/core/src/locales/` (`en.ts`, `ar.ts`, `de.ts`, `es.ts`, `fr.ts`, `it.ts`,
`ml.ts`, `pt_BR.ts`, `tr.ts`, `zh_CN.ts`), aggregated by `src/locales/index.ts` into the
`builtinTranslations` map that `i18n.ts` imports. That split exists on purpose: it means
adding or fixing a translation is a one-file diff in your own language, with no risk of
merge-conflicting with someone else translating a different language in the same PR
cycle, and no need to scroll past 400 lines of languages you don't read.

### Adding a brand-new built-in language

1. Copy `packages/core/src/locales/en.ts` to `<locale>.ts`, named for the locale code
   you're adding (e.g. `ak.ts` for Akan; use an underscore for region variants the way
   `pt_BR.ts` does).
2. Translate every string **value** — keep every object/array key identical to `en.ts`.
   Leave `:placeholder`-style tokens (`:a`, `:max`, `:theme`, ...) and `%s` printf-style
   tokens untouched; `loomiT()`'s template substitution fills those in at call time
   regardless of language.
3. Import the new file in `packages/core/src/locales/index.ts` and add it to the
   `builtinTranslations` map.
4. Optionally add the locale code to the `LoomiLocale` union in `src/i18n.ts` — this is
   purely an autocomplete nicety, since the type also accepts any `string` and the
   runtime lookup works regardless.
5. `pnpm --filter @loomidev/core build` (or `pnpm build` from root) to confirm it compiles,
   then add the locale to the "Built-in locales" line in `packages/core/README.md`.

### Fixing or improving an existing translation

No aggregation step needed — just edit the relevant `<locale>.ts` under
`packages/core/src/locales/` and rebuild `@loomidev/core`.

### Adding a language without touching this repo at all

Any consumer can register a translation at runtime via `defineLoomiTranslations(locale,
translations)` (exported from `@loomidev/core`) without a PR against this repo — see the
"Internationalization" section of `packages/core/README.md` for the consumer-facing
docs. It deep-merges into whatever's already registered for that locale, so a partial
object covering only the keys someone cares about is fine; anything missing still falls
back to English. That's the right path for a quick or unofficial translation; promoting
it to a real `locales/<x>.ts` file (steps above) is worth doing once it's complete and
you want it shipped as a built-in default.

---

## Publishing to npm

### One-time account setup

1. Create an npm account: https://www.npmjs.com/signup
2. **Decide who owns the `@loomidev` scope.** Scoped packages require _someone_ own the
   `loomidev` organization on npm. Either create a free npm org at
   https://www.npmjs.com/org/create (free orgs publish unlimited **public** scoped
   packages — what we need), or, if `loomidev` is taken, rename the scope everywhere
   (every `package.json` + every internal `@loomidev/...` import) _before_ the first
   publish — not after.
3. `npm login` (shared auth token, also used by `pnpm publish`).
4. Add `"publishConfig": { "access": "public" }` to every package's `package.json` so you
   don't need to remember `--access public` on every command (npm defaults new scoped
   packages to requiring a paid private plan unless told otherwise).

### The mechanic you must understand before publishing anything

`packages/forms/package.json` says `"@loomidev/input": "workspace:^"`. That syntax is **not
valid outside this monorepo** — published literally, `npm install @loomidev/forms` would
fail for anyone, since the npm registry doesn't understand `workspace:^`.

**`pnpm publish` automatically rewrites `workspace:^` to the dependency's actual
currently-published version** (a real `^x.y.z` range) inside the tarball it uploads — it
does not touch your local `package.json`. This is why it's safe to use `workspace:^`
everywhere during development. You must use `pnpm publish` (not bare `npm publish`) for
this rewriting to happen.

### Versioning strategy

**Already set up.** This repo uses [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)
(`@changesets/cli`, config at `.changeset/config.json`) — `access` is set to `"public"`
(required for new scoped packages) and `@loomidev/root` is in `ignore` (it's private and
never published). Every package's `package.json` already has
`"publishConfig": { "access": "public" }` too, so a raw `pnpm publish` never needs the
flag remembered by hand. Workflow:

1. After a meaningful change, run `pnpm changeset` — interactively records which
   packages changed and the bump type, writing a markdown file under `.changeset/` to
   commit alongside the change.
2. On release day, `pnpm changeset version` — bumps affected `package.json` versions,
   rewrites internal `workspace:^` ranges where needed, updates each package's
   `CHANGELOG.md`. Commit this.
3. `pnpm changeset publish` — changesets' own publish wrapper; only publishes packages
   whose version actually changed, and tags each in git.

### Manual publish (no tooling, one-off release)

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm -r publish --access public --dry-run   # ALWAYS dry-run first
pnpm -r publish --access public             # the real thing
```

`pnpm -r publish` runs in every workspace package in dependency order automatically. The
dry run shows exactly what `npm pack` would include per package — confirm only `dist/`
(and, for `@loomidev/theme`, also `palette.json` + `src/tailwind-colors.css` per its `files`
field) is being uploaded.

### Does publish order matter?

For the **very first release**, yes in one sense: if `@loomidev/button` finished publishing
before `@loomidev/theme`/`@loomidev/icons` existed on the registry at all, `npm install
@loomidev/button` would fail for end users immediately. `pnpm -r publish` already publishes
dependency-first (`theme`, `core`, `icons` → components → groupings → `components`
umbrella) — don't fight this by publishing one package manually out of order on the first
release. After that, every package exists at _some_ version, so order matters less, but
keep doing dependencies-first anyway.

### CI

**Already set up**, in `.github/workflows/`:

- **`ci.yml`** — runs on every push to `main` and every PR: `pnpm install
--frozen-lockfile && pnpm build && pnpm typecheck && pnpm test`. This is your real gate
  against broken PRs; it runs the full smoke-test suite from [Automated smoke tests](#automated-smoke-tests)
  in a real headless Chromium via `actions/setup-node` + `pnpm/action-setup`.
- **`release.yml`** — the [Changesets GitHub Action](https://github.com/changesets/action)
  pattern: on push to `main`, it either opens/updates a "Version Packages" PR (if there
  are unconsumed `.changeset/*.md` files) or publishes to npm with **provenance**
  (`id-token: write` permission, so npm can cryptographically attest the package was
  built from this exact commit in CI rather than someone's laptop) once that PR merges.

CI can run without npm credentials. The publish step in `release.yml` needs:

- `NPM_TOKEN` — an npm **automation** token with publish rights on the `@loomidev` org.
  Create one at npmjs.com → avatar → **Access Tokens** → **Generate New Token** →
  **Granular Access Token** (or **Classic Token** → **Automation**, on older accounts).
  npm shows the token **once**, at creation time, and never again — copy it immediately
  and paste it straight into the GitHub repo secret (`github.com/loomidev/loomiui` →
  Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret → name it
  `NPM_TOKEN`). If you navigated away before copying it, the token can't be retrieved;
  delete the unusable one from npm's Access Tokens list and generate a new one.

`GITHUB_TOKEN` is provided automatically by Actions; no setup is needed for it.

### How this ties to the GitHub repo

Everything in [CI](#ci) is GitHub-Actions-driven, so it only works against the
actual GitHub repo (`origin` is `github.com/loomidev/loomiui`; `main` and `development`
are both pushed there). Concretely, here's the loop from "merge a PR" to "package shows
up on npm":

1. A PR merges into `main`. `ci.yml` already ran against the PR itself (build +
   typecheck + test, [CI](#ci)); the merge to `main` is what triggers `release.yml`.
2. If that merge included unconsumed `.changeset/*.md` files (someone ran `pnpm
changeset`, [Versioning strategy](#versioning-strategy)), the Changesets GitHub Action opens or
   updates a standing **"Version Packages" PR** on the same repo — it does **not**
   publish yet. That PR is itself reviewable on GitHub like any other: it shows exactly
   which packages bump, and by how much, generated straight from the changeset files'
   contents.
3. Merging _that_ PR into `main` re-triggers `release.yml`. This time there's nothing
   left unconsumed, so the action runs `pnpm changeset publish` instead, pushing to the
   npm registry and creating a git tag per published package back on the GitHub repo
   (e.g. `@loomidev/button@0.2.0`).
4. **Provenance is what cryptographically ties the two together.** Because this job runs
   in GitHub Actions with `id-token: write`, npm can attest — and display on each
   package's npm page — that the published tarball was built from this exact GitHub
   repo, commit, and workflow run, not assembled by hand on a laptop. Only packages
   published through this CI path get that badge; a manual `pnpm publish` from a local
   machine ([Manual publish (no tooling, one-off release)](#manual-publish-no-tooling-one-off-release)) never does.
5. The repo secrets from [CI](#ci) live on GitHub itself —
   `github.com/loomidev/loomiui` → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions — not
   anywhere in this codebase. Until `NPM_TOKEN` is set there, `release.yml` still runs
   and will still open the "Version Packages" PR, but the `pnpm changeset publish` step
   fails for lack of registry credentials.

Each package should keep its `"repository"` metadata pointed at the monorepo and its own
package directory, e.g.

```json
"repository": { "type": "git", "url": "https://github.com/loomidev/loomiui.git", "directory": "packages/button" }
```

npm renders this as a link on the package's registry page, and the `directory` field is
what lets someone land on `@loomidev/button`'s npm listing and get back to
`packages/button/` in this exact repo, rather than just the repo root.

## Should each component be its own git repository?

**No — keep one monorepo, single git repository.**

This question likely comes from seeing BladewindUI's `monorepo-builder.php` and
per-package `composer.json` files — on Packagist (PHP's registry), each Composer package
conventionally maps to its own dedicated git repo, and BladewindUI's script does a **git
subtree split**: mirroring each `packages/<x>/` subfolder out into its own read-only
GitHub repo, purely because Packagist needs something per-package to point at.

**npm has no such requirement.** The registry only ever sees the tarball `npm
publish`/`pnpm publish` uploads — it has no concept of "this package's repository" beyond
an optional, purely informational `"repository"` field that npm displays as a link and
never validates. `npm publish` works identically whether run from inside a folder that's
part of a huge monorepo or from no repo at all.

Splitting into many repos here would be pure overhead with no benefit, and would actively
hurt this project specifically:

- **Cross-cutting changes are common and need to be atomic.** Renaming the
  `--loomi-accent` mechanism touched `core`, `checkbox`, `radio`, and `toggle` in one
  change; making the CSS prefix configurable touched `theme`'s `palette.json` plus every
  component's build script. In one repo that's one reviewable commit. Across many repos
  that becomes many PRs that all need to land together, with real risk of drift.
- **This is the standard pattern** for many small, independently-versioned, interdependent
  npm packages maintained by one team — Babel, Jest, Vite's first-party plugins, MUI, and
  Changesets itself all ship this way.
- **You lose nothing at scale.** GitHub issue templates/labels can route "this is about
  the button" without a dedicated repo per component.

Concretely: keep changes in this single repository and let npm packages be separated at
publish time, not by splitting the source into many git repos.

## Open-source readiness — status

### Done

- **`LICENSE`** at the repo root (MIT, matching every package's `"license"` field).
- **CI**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (build + typecheck + test on every push/PR) and
  `release.yml` (Changesets-driven publish with npm provenance) — see [CI](#ci).
- **Smoke-level automated tests** via `@web/test-runner` — see [Automated smoke tests](#automated-smoke-tests).
  Coverage spans many packages and recurring patterns, but it is not a full behavioral
  test suite for every component.
- **`SECURITY.md`** with a private disclosure path, plus GitHub issue templates
  (`bug_report.yml`, `feature_request.yml`) and a PR template.
- **npm publish provenance**: wired into `release.yml` (`id-token: write` +
  Changesets' action), see [How this ties to the GitHub repo](#how-this-ties-to-the-github-repo). The `NPM_TOKEN`
  repo secret is now set on `github.com/loomidev/loomiui`, so publishing is live.
- **Versioning/changelog automation** via Changesets — see [Versioning strategy](#versioning-strategy).
- **Explicit browser support matrix**, a **React/Vue/Angular interop note**, a
  **zero-install CDN quick start**, and the **`@loomidev/mcp-server`** highlight — all now
  in the user-facing `README.md` rather than buried here.
- **An accessibility pass across the overlay/floating-panel components** — not a full
  audit, but every previously-known gap is closed. `modal` traps Tab focus, moves focus
  into the dialog on open, and restores it to the trigger on close. `tabs` supports the
  WAI-ARIA APG roving-tabindex pattern (Arrow/Home/End, with automatic activation
  matching its existing click behavior). `select`'s open listbox and `colorpicker`'s
  swatch grid both support the standard `aria-activedescendant` keyboard pattern
  (Arrow/Home/End/Enter, previously mouse-only for colorpicker). `dropmenu` and
  `popover` now close (rather than staying open with focus adrift) when focus leaves
  them and restore focus to the trigger: `dropmenu`'s Tab closes the menu without
  trapping it (the correct non-trap menu-button pattern, since its items are real,
  focusable DOM nodes) and Escape/item-selection explicitly refocus `.loomi-trigger`;
  `popover` — a non-modal `role="dialog"` with arbitrary rich content — closes on
  `focusout` leaving its trigger+panel subtree and on Escape, restoring focus, but
  deliberately isn't Tab-trapped like `modal` since trapping is a modal-only pattern.
  All of the above are covered by smoke tests in [Automated smoke tests](#automated-smoke-tests).

### Still open

- **Deeper test coverage** for component-specific edge cases — extend opportunistically
  per [Automated smoke tests](#automated-smoke-tests), especially when changing form controls,
  overlays, keyboard navigation, or generated styles.
- **Accessibility beyond the overlay components above** hasn't had a dedicated pass —
  e.g. `context-menu`, `command-palette`, `data-grid`, and other components with custom
  keyboard interaction haven't been audited against the WAI-ARIA APG the way the
  components above have.
